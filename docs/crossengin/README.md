# CrossEngin

> **Status:** In active design. ADRs in progress. No production code in this repository.

This repository holds the vision, architecture decision records (ADRs), and design documents for **CrossEngin** — an AI-native application platform.

## What CrossEngin is

CrossEngin is a meta-application platform. Tenants describe a business, regulation, mission, or process in natural language; the **AI Architect** provisions a complete, multi-tenant, compliant, integration-ready application on a shared **kernel** — covering data model, workflows, roles, forms, dashboards, reports, and integrations.

ERP is the first family of applications built on CrossEngin. The platform also targets public-sector digitalization, healthcare digitalization at national scale, education, NGOs, and bespoke enterprise applications.

## How to read this repository

Start with [`vision.md`](vision.md) — the north-star concept document.

Then [`adr/index.md`](adr/index.md) — the running index of all architecture decisions.

Individual decisions live at `adr/NNNN-<slug>.md`. They follow the template at [`adr/0000-template.md`](adr/0000-template.md).

## ADR statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Proposed** | Drafted. Under review. Not yet binding. |
| **Accepted** | Reviewed and adopted. Implementable. Constrains future architecture. |
| **Superseded by ADR-XXXX** | A later decision replaces this one. Both ADRs cross-reference each other. |
| **Deprecated** | No longer applies, no replacement. |

Accepted ADRs are not rewritten. If a decision changes, a new ADR supersedes the old one.
